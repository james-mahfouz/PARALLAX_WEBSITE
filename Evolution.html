                    <h1>Discover how AI evolved</h1>
                    <p>A popular tool that can respond to questions in eerily human ways, called ChatGPT, has captured the 
                      internet's attention as people use it to write song lyrics, essays, TV episodes and more.
                      Now, OpenAI, the company behind the chatbot, is rocketing into the mainstream. Microsoft is reportedly 
                      investing up to $10 billion in the company, hoping it can use ChatGPT to resuscitate its search engine, 
                      Bing, and improve products in its Microsoft Office suite.</p>
                    <p>So How open AI evolved</p>

                <h2>Can Machine think</h2>
                <p>In the first half of the 20th century, science fiction familiarized the world with the concept of artificially 
                    intelligent robots. It began with the “heartless” Tin man from the Wizard of Oz and continued with the humanoid 
                    robot that impersonated Maria in Metropolis. By the 1950s, we had a generation of scientists, mathematicians, and 
                    philosophers with the concept of artificial intelligence (or AI) culturally assimilated in their minds. One such 
                    person was Alan Turing, a young British polymath who explored the mathematical possibility of artificial 
                    intelligence. Turing suggested that humans use available information as well as reason in order to solve problems 
                    and make decisions, so why can’t machines do the same thing? This was the logical framework of his 1950 paper, 
                    Computing Machinery and Intelligence in which he discussed how to build intelligent machines and how to test their 
                    intelligence.</p>

            <h2>Making the Pursuit Possible</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately, talk is cheap. What stopped Turing from getting to work right then and there? First, computers 
                needed to fundamentally change. Before 1949 computers lacked a key prerequisite for intelligence: they couldn’t 
                store commands, only execute them. In other words, computers could be told what to do but couldn’t remember 
                what they did. Second, computing was extremely expensive. In the early 1950s, the cost of leasing a computer 
                ran up to $200,000 a month. Only prestigious universities and big technology companies could afford to dillydally 
                in these uncharted waters. A proof of concept as well as advocacy from high profile people were needed to 
                persuade funding sources that machine intelligence was worth pursuing.</p>

                <h2>The Conference that Started it All</h2>
                <p>Five years later, the proof of concept was initialized through Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw, and Herbert Simon’s, 
                    Logic Theorist. The Logic Theorist was a program designed to mimic the problem solving skills of a human and 
                    was funded by Research and Development (RAND) Corporation. It’s considered by many to be the first artificial 
                    intelligence program and was presented at the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence 
                    (DSRPAI) hosted by John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky in 1956. In this historic conference, McCarthy, imagining 
                    a great collaborative effort, brought together top researchers from various fields for an open ended discussion 
                    on artificial intelligence, the term which he coined at the very event. Sadly, the conference fell short of 
                    McCarthy’s expectations; people came and went as they pleased, and there was failure to agree on standard methods 
                    for the field. Despite this, everyone whole-heartedly aligned with the sentiment that AI was achievable. 
                    The significance of this event cannot be undermined as it catalyzed the next twenty years of AI research.</p>
