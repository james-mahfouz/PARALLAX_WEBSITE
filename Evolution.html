                    <h1>Discover how AI evolved</h1>
                    <p>A popular tool that can respond to questions in eerily human ways, called ChatGPT, has captured the 
                      internet's attention as people use it to write song lyrics, essays, TV episodes and more.
                      Now, OpenAI, the company behind the chatbot, is rocketing into the mainstream. Microsoft is reportedly 
                      investing up to $10 billion in the company, hoping it can use ChatGPT to resuscitate its search engine, 
                      Bing, and improve products in its Microsoft Office suite.</p>

                <h2>Can Machine think</h2>
                <p>In the first half of the 20th century, science fiction familiarized the world with the concept of artificially 
                    intelligent robots. It began with the “heartless” Tin man from the Wizard of Oz and continued with the humanoid 
                    robot that impersonated Maria in Metropolis. By the 1950s, we had a generation of scientists, mathematicians, and 
                    philosophers with the concept of artificial intelligence (or AI) culturally assimilated in their minds. One such 
                    person was Alan Turing, a young British polymath who explored the mathematical possibility of artificial 
                    intelligence. Turing suggested that humans use available information as well as reason in order to solve problems 
                    and make decisions, so why can’t machines do the same thing? This was the logical framework of his 1950 paper, 
                    Computing Machinery and Intelligence in which he discussed how to build intelligent machines and how to test their 
                    intelligence.</p>

            <h2>Making the Pursuit Possible</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately, talk is cheap. What stopped Turing from getting to work right then and there? First, computers 
                needed to fundamentally change. Before 1949 computers lacked a key prerequisite for intelligence: they couldn’t 
                store commands, only execute them. In other words, computers could be told what to do but couldn’t remember 
                what they did. Second, computing was extremely expensive. In the early 1950s, the cost of leasing a computer 
                ran up to $200,000 a month. Only prestigious universities and big technology companies could afford to dillydally 
                in these uncharted waters. A proof of concept as well as advocacy from high profile people were needed to 
                persuade funding sources that machine intelligence was worth pursuing.</p>
