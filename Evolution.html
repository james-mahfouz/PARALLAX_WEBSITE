                    <h1>Discover how AI evolved</h1>
                    <p>A popular tool that can respond to questions in eerily human ways, called ChatGPT, has captured the 
                      internet's attention as people use it to write song lyrics, essays, TV episodes and more.
                      Now, OpenAI, the company behind the chatbot, is rocketing into the mainstream. Microsoft is reportedly 
                      investing up to $10 billion in the company, hoping it can use ChatGPT to resuscitate its search engine, 
                      Bing, and improve products in its Microsoft Office suite.</p>

                <h2>Can Machine think</h2>
                <p>In the first half of the 20th century, science fiction familiarized the world with the concept of artificially 
                    intelligent robots. It began with the “heartless” Tin man from the Wizard of Oz and continued with the humanoid 
                    robot that impersonated Maria in Metropolis. By the 1950s, we had a generation of scientists, mathematicians, and 
                    philosophers with the concept of artificial intelligence (or AI) culturally assimilated in their minds. One such 
                    person was Alan Turing, a young British polymath who explored the mathematical possibility of artificial 
                    intelligence. Turing suggested that humans use available information as well as reason in order to solve problems 
                    and make decisions, so why can’t machines do the same thing? This was the logical framework of his 1950 paper, 
                    Computing Machinery and Intelligence in which he discussed how to build intelligent machines and how to test their 
                    intelligence.</p>

            <h2>Making the Pursuit Possible</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately, talk is cheap. What stopped Turing from getting to work right then and there? First, computers 
                needed to fundamentally change. Before 1949 computers lacked a key prerequisite for intelligence: they couldn’t 
                store commands, only execute them. In other words, computers could be told what to do but couldn’t remember 
                what they did. Second, computing was extremely expensive. In the early 1950s, the cost of leasing a computer 
                ran up to $200,000 a month. Only prestigious universities and big technology companies could afford to dillydally 
                in these uncharted waters. A proof of concept as well as advocacy from high profile people were needed to 
                persuade funding sources that machine intelligence was worth pursuing.</p>

                <h2>The Conference that Started it All</h2>
                <p>Five years later, the proof of concept was initialized through Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw, and Herbert Simon’s, 
                    Logic Theorist. The Logic Theorist was a program designed to mimic the problem solving skills of a human and 
                    was funded by Research and Development (RAND) Corporation. It’s considered by many to be the first artificial 
                    intelligence program and was presented at the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence 
                    (DSRPAI) hosted by John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky in 1956. In this historic conference, McCarthy, imagining 
                    a great collaborative effort, brought together top researchers from various fields for an open ended discussion 
                    on artificial intelligence, the term which he coined at the very event. Sadly, the conference fell short of 
                    McCarthy’s expectations; people came and went as they pleased, and there was failure to agree on standard methods 
                    for the field. Despite this, everyone whole-heartedly aligned with the sentiment that AI was achievable. 
                    The significance of this event cannot be undermined as it catalyzed the next twenty years of AI research.</p>

            <h3>Roller Coaster of Success </h3>
            <p>The period from 1957 to 1974 saw significant progress in the field of AI, with improvements in computing power 
                and machine learning algorithms. However, despite early successes such as Newell and Simon's General Problem 
                Solver and Weizenbaum's ELIZA, there was still a long way to go before achieving goals such as natural language 
                processing and self-recognition. The lack of computational power was a major obstacle, with computers being too 
                weak to exhibit intelligence</p>

            <h3>Set backs</h3>
            <p>Funding and research slowed down for a decade. In the 1980s, AI saw a resurgence with the introduction of 
                deep learning techniques and expert systems. The Japanese government heavily funded AI-related projects but most 
                ambitious goals were not met. In the 1990s and 2000s, AI achieved many landmark goals such as the defeat of the 
                world chess champion by IBM's Deep Blue and the implementation of speech recognition software on Windows. 
                Kismet, a robot capable of recognizing and displaying emotions, demonstrated the ability of machines to handle 
                human emotion.</p>

                <p>The reason we have made progress in artificial intelligence despite not significantly changing how we code 
                    it is due to the improvement in computer storage and processing speed. Moore's Law, which predicts a 
                    doubling of memory and speed every year, has finally caught up to and exceeded our needs. This has allowed 
                    AI to perform tasks such as defeating human champions in games like chess and Go. As we saturate the 
                    capabilities of AI with our current computational power, we wait for Moore's Law to continue its progress.</p>

                <h2>Artificial Intelligence is Everywhere</h2>
                <p>In today's era of "big data," the ability to gather vast amounts of information that is too cumbersome for 
                    humans to process is now possible. Artificial intelligence has already made significant contributions to 
                    several industries such as technology, banking, marketing, and entertainment. Even if algorithms do not 
                    improve substantially, the sheer volume of data and immense computing power enables AI to learn through 
                    brute force. While there may be indications that the growth rate predicted by Moore's Law is slowing down, 
                    the rapid expansion of data collection shows no signs of abating. Breakthroughs in fields like 
                    computer science, mathematics, and neuroscience offer potential solutions for overcoming the limitations 
                    of Moore's Law.</p>

                <h2>The Future of AI</h2>
                <p>Looking to the future, the advancement of AI language appears to be the next major development. Conversing 
                    with machines has already become a normal occurrence, with even companies reaching out to people through 
                    automated calls. It is possible to envision interacting with an expert system through natural, flowing 
                    conversation or have two people speaking different languages translated in real-time. Additionally, we can 
                    anticipate seeing autonomous vehicles on the road within the next two decades. The ultimate goal, in the 
                    long-term, is to create general intelligence - a machine with cognitive abilities surpassing that of humans 
                    in all tasks. However, achieving this feat within the next 50 years seems implausible, not only due to the 
                    technical limitations but also the ethical considerations. Therefore, discussions on machine policy and 
                    ethics will be vital in the future. For now, we can let AI continue to progress and integrate into society.</p>
