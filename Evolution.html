                    <h1>Discover how AI evolved</h1>
                    <p>A popular tool that can respond to questions in eerily human ways, called ChatGPT, has captured the 
                      internet's attention as people use it to write song lyrics, essays, TV episodes and more.
                      Now, OpenAI, the company behind the chatbot, is rocketing into the mainstream. Microsoft is reportedly 
                      investing up to $10 billion in the company, hoping it can use ChatGPT to resuscitate its search engine, 
                      Bing, and improve products in its Microsoft Office suite.</p>
                    <p>So How open AI evolved</p>

                <h2>What is OpenAI’s history</h2>
                <p>The San Francisco-based artificial intelligence lab started in 2015 as a nonprofit, trying to build 
                  “artificial general intelligence,” or AGI, which is essentially software that’s as smart as humans.
                  The company wanted to protect against a future in which big tech companies, like Google, mastered AI technology 
                  and monopolized its benefits. The nonprofit’s goal was to build AI software transparently and make its products 
                  open-source so the world could benefit.</p>
