    <section class="About-Random-text"> OpenAI is a non-profit research organization with the mission of creating and guiding artificial intelligence 
      (AI) in ways that benefit all humankind. OpenAI, however, must overcome significant obstacles, most notably resolving the evident problems 
      with accuracy, bias, and harm in its products. In short, the latter mapped out a challenging course. It would develop its AI products using
       incredibly massive amounts of data and potent neural networks, software that is loosely based on the neurons in the human brain.</section>
